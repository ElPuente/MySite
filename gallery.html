    <p>These two pictures are the first two images I created in Photoshop and Illustrator. At first, it was hard to create my vision, because I had not idea on how to use these programs.<br><br>
    I was desperate, because I wanted to express my idea the way I see it in my mind, but I realized that with practice I will be able to become familiar with the programs and communicate my ideas to the world.</p>
    <h3>
    It was fun learning Audacity and creati9ng a short story with multiple recordings. We are used to hearing sounds and audio form a visual content, so it was nice to be able to separate both ways of communication.<br><br>
    
    The fun continued with GIF. For this assigment, I recorded myself pretending to be dancing and I used that material to create my gif in Photoshop. It was cool to be able to create my first gif.<br><br>
        
    After Effect was the last program I was able to work with and create a Text Animation. This program seems very confusing, but it's something I see myself spending time learning how to use and make cool animaitons. I am looking forward to learning this program.
    <br><br>
    
    Below are additional designs I made in Photoshop and Illustrator. I think they look good, I'm happy with my progress.

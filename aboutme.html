    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jairo Arauz, I am a current BMCC student.<br> 
    I am currently pursuing an Associate in Science (A.S.) degree.
    <br><br>
    Right after High School, I had the opportunity to start a career in media for major companies <br>such as <em>Viacom/MTV Networks, Discovery</em> and <em>Vme Media</em>. My resposibilities included <br>the scheduling of commercials and the live programming for a spanish network.
    <br><br>
    My schedule was always busy, it was hard to finish my Graphic Design studies.<br> I kept postponing my education, because I wanted to take advantage of every opportunity<br> that opened up for me. In 2015, I decided to change my career and look for a job<br> that would allow me to finish my education.
    <br><br>
        I always had a passion for Art. I enjoy the work of others drawing, photography <br>and digital designings. Such work inspire and motivate me to pursue my dream as a Graphic <br>and Web Designer. I can't wait to use my creativity and new skills to create attractive websites.</p>

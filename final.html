    There are many reasons why kids might ask to stay home from school sometimes, including just needing to take a day off to recharge. If your child often wants to skip school, it’s important to understand why.<br><br>
    What can you say when your child doesn’t want to go to school? There is helpful information out there that can help parents communicate with the child when he or she doesn’t want to go to school (Below is a link for parents to read and provide support for their children).<br><br>
    Meanwhile, the system needs to step in and create a better structure that can help students and their education and growth. Many parents disagree with the current structure that is in place running the school system nationwide. A mother who is also a teacher, said the following about the impact school had on her kids: "My kids were not solving real problems and exploring new ideas—rather, they were turning in assignments and getting grades. And for all four of them, the most meaningful learning often happened when they weren’t in school." Maybe, those running the education system need to pay closer attention to comments like this and what families are noticing from schools and the way they function.<br><br>
    There is a crisis in education in America. Kids in high school can't spell their names or even hold a pencil properly. Students from a young age are not being taught, but they are being programmed how to do things. They don't have any understanding of why things work in a certain way and why. In a New York Times article, students were asked to weigh in some findings about schools. The students were able to express the amount of pressure and expectation they were under. It was overwhelming. They said that the amount of class work and homework was too much and it was impossible to remember and learn the things that were thought about in school.</p>

Everyone needs to be ready for negative feedback and accept that change is a must.<br><br>The future is at stake and lives will suffer if action is not taken. With everyone's participation and the will to change, it can lead to the right path for a brighter future.<br><br> How can you get involved and what can you do?

            <h3>Millions of money is being invested in education.<br>
                We have the resource and finance to excel in knowledge and
                growth.<br>
                It is good go know that we have a goverment that is willing<br>
                to invest in their people and future, but I also learned that<br> we may not have the right structure to help and make sure that <br> the funds are used correctly.<br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, I noticed that many kids or young people have<br> different views about their education and future plans.
                <br>In a recent survey I made in a High School, I learned students from different background <br>have good and bad views about education.  Some are not sure about <br>what they want in their future, others hate school and other students <br>can't write their names.  I found that to be troubling and alarming.<br>
